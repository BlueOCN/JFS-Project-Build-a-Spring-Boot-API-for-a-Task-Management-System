# JFS-Project-Build-a-Spring-Boot-API-for-a-Task-Management-System
Create a Spring Boot API for a Task Management System. It should enable users to manage tasksâ€”creating, viewing, updating, and deleting them. The API will persist data using H2 or MySQL and expose endpoints for task operations, including marking tasks as complete. Ensure structured responses and appropriate HTTP status codes.
